## Classification Models & Results

| Model                   | Accuracy (%) |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| K-Nearest Neighbors     | **99.91**    |
| SVM (RBF Kernel)        | **100.0**    |
| Logistic Regression     | 94.67        |
| Decision Tree (Gini)    | 96.14        |
| Decision Tree (Entropy) | 95.85        |

**Best Performers**:

* **KNN** and **SVM (RBF)** consistently achieved near-perfect classification performance.
